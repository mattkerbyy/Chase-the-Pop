# 🛍️ Chase the Pop - Collectibles Store

Welcome to my collectibles store website project. This compact storefront is built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Shadcn UI**, and **Framer Motion** to practice frontend development and showcase my business.

## About

This project is a Next.js app styled with Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Framer Motion, and developed in **VS Code**. It is a place to learn modern frontend patterns while presenting collectible items. Additionally, it was an opportunity to learn new techniques for improving SEO, including optimizing metadata, structuring content, and ensuring clean, crawl-friendly code.
