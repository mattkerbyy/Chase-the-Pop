# 🛍️ Chase the Pop - Collectibles Store

Welcome to my collectibles store website project. This compact storefront is built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS** to practice frontend development and showcase my business.

## About

This project is a Next.js app styled with Tailwind CSS and developed in **VS Code**. It is a place to learn modern frontend patterns while presenting collectible items.

## Features
